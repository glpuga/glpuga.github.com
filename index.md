## Welcome to my site!

Welcome to my personal web page. I'm still playing with this so keep in mind that this is a beta. Feel free to send me a message if you find a problem with the presentation or contents.


### Want to know who am I?

Electronic Engineer, with a Specialization on Embedded Systems and a Master on GNSS Signal Tracking Algorithms.

After graduating I stayed in university for about ten years, working as an embedded systems developer in a research laboratory. During this time I became specialized in embedded systems for space vehicles, real time software and communications systems, having worked mostly developing software for embedded GNSS receivers for rockets.

During this time I also spent some time an assistant professor for Power Electronics and Advanced Computer Architecture classes.

Two years ago I left academy and joined [Ekumen Labs](https://www.ekumenlabs.com/), a very cool software development company that specializes on software for robotics and other some very cool projects.
